# TrollFizz
A zip file containing 2 exes made in python

Alright BEFORE you download these, be ready. Dont use these on a host machine, use on a vm.
There are two TrollFizz files
Trollfizz
Trollfizz2

Trollfizz is a weak version of Trollfizz2, although it does mess up some files on the desktop (.txts are near guranteed to get messed up), it could be used on your host machine as long as you have saved your data, it doesnt exactly cause much damage. It also does stuff on your web browser

Trollfizz2 is essentially just an application spammer, it spams stuff such as "Calculator" or "Paint", best to use this one on a VM. Extremely annoyinng, creates many popup windows with random stuff in it, trying to use taskmanager may be difficult since it will get covered by the spammed applications.
